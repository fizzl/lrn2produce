It feel like the first day of autumn in Finland. I am at my house. It's saturday morning 10am.
I want to learn how to produce a dubstep song. I have no other obligations today, so I am probably going to 
do this all day. I really liked Skrillex' Kill Everybody, so I'm trying to analyze that.

I'm trying to do learn some time management at the same time. I will set a timer for 25 minutes at a time.
I will work on one task for that time. If I complete one, I may switch to next. But no task switching unless the timer beeps.
Between, I will have small breaks doing some housework like doing dishes and laundry.

15:00
Analysis done. Spent some time driving a friend around. Had lunch.
Starting to crate a drumrack. I want something somewhat realistic. 

18:00
Having a lot of trouble with wubs. lfo-sync doesn't work right for bass-station.
Making progress.

22:00
I dun goofed. I forgot to take breaks and kept on fucking around with stuff even though 
I realized everything was going to shit.
Ohwell. Tomorrow i'll trash those wubs and start over.
